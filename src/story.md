**Interviewer:** Hello, welcome.  We were expecting you.  Please, take a seat.  

**Candidate:** Thank you.

**Interviewer:** So you're applying for the Senior [[PROFESSION]] position?

**Candidate:** That's correct, I have 7 years experience [[COMMON TASK]], I've worked with clients [[SECOND COMMON TASK]] off and on for 4 years.  

**Interviewer:** Great! We're looking to hire strong [[PROFESSION]] around here.  People who are well-rounded self-starters.  Anyway, let's get started.  [[OFF THE WALL QUESTION]]

**Candidate:** Uhh, I'm sorry?

**Interviewer:** It's a simple question.  Grad-students have an easier time with this, usually our candidates who have been out in the workforce for a few years get rusty on this. 

**Candidate:** Right, well usually I would have access to a [[ESSENTIAL TOOL OF THE TRADE]] when working.

**Interviewer:** The goal of this exercise is to write the solution directly on this whiteboard.

**Candidate:** Hold on, normally while I'm working I use a [[ESSENTIAL TOOL OF THE TRADE]] or a [[SECOND ESSENTIAL TOOL OF THE TRADE]].  Why are you testing me on [[PROFESSION]] skills without a [[ESSENTIAL TOOL OF THE TRADE]].

**Interviewer:** Studies from major companies have shown that-

**Candidate:** Ok, right. I think I know the solution to this.  It's [[SOLUTION TO OFF THE WALL QUESTION]].

**Interviewer:** I'm sorry, that's from the [[INTERVIEW PREP BOOK NAME]].

**Candidate:** Is it?  That's a common solution to that problem in this field.

**Interviewer:** We like to look for well-rounded candidates.  Have you ever won any [[PROFESSIONAL COMPETITION NAME]]?

**Candidate:** [[PROFESSIONAL COMPETITION NAME]]?

**Interviewer:** [[PROFESSIONAL COMPETITION NAME]].  It's where [[PROFESSION]]s get together for 48 hours and compete [[COMMON TASK]].  There's pizza and beer and it looks really great on your resume.

**Candidate:** No.  No, I've never done that.

**Interviewer:** That's unfortunate, we like to hire [[PROFESSIONAL COMPETITION NAME]] winners here.  No, I'm sorry, this just isn't working out.
